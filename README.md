# ninjaref / data

This repository contains granular, hand-collected data on American Ninja Warrior runs. We track competitors across seasons, courses and obstacles&mdash;allowing for detailed analysis and comparisons. You can read more about the [project here](https://jdkato.github.io/2016/12/21/anw7-a-look-back-at-an-historic-season.html).

Data acquisition is a three step process: we collect hand-timed run data in CSV format, ensure the collected data passes our validation suite, and then transform it into a PostgreSQL database used to power the Ninja Reference front end.
